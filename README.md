# Depression Readout from Subcallosal Cingulate

## Overview
Oscillations measured over months in the subcallosal cingulate may help us _decode_ depression - or find a measure that can help us better track the depression symptoms of patients.

This repo is the code for Chapter 3 of my dissertation.


## Introduction

## Methods

## Discussion

## Conclusions
Part of measured depression can be decoded from oscillations in the SCC.
In particular, $\delta$ and $\beta$, in asymmetric patterns, are involved.
